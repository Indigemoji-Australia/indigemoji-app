Files kept here to be imported into all platforms. These files are not referenced in the codebase.
All sound filenames must be in lowercase with no spaces.

Sound files must be in the following places:
Android: Save your sound clip files under the directory android/app/src/main/res/raw. Note that files in this directory must be lowercase and underscored (e.g. my_file_name.mp3) and that subdirectories are not supported by Android.
iOS: Open Xcode and add your sound files to the project (Right-click the project and select Add Files to [PROJECTNAME])

We may want to make an automation tool for doing both of the above at some point.
